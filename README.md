# Visualizing MobilityDB data using QGIS
This document will go over the possible solutions to display MobilityDB data types using the QGIS application.

## QGIS high level description

QGIS data is displayed inside layers. The actual data can be stored in different ways:
- The layer could be linked to a table inside a postgresql database with a postgis extension. In this case, if the table contains a geometry type column (point, linestring, polygon, etc.), the data will be automatically "recognized" by QGIS and displayed.
- The data is stored inside the layer's memory. Data is organized as *features*.

### Features
Features are the way data are represented inside a memory layer. Features have a geometry and attributes. The attributes contain information about the data that isn't displayed (e.g. a name, a time, an number such as an age) but can be used to filter which features should be rendered inside the layer or how they should be rendered (for example changing their size or color).
